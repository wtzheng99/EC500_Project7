The codes for data preprocessing is under the 'Data Preprocessing' directory, including how to segment patches from the original whole slide image, how to pair the counts with inflammtory levels.

In Feature Extraction, you will find the code for extracting features from ResNet50 and [PLIP (Pathology Language and Image Pre-Training)](https://github.com/PathologyFoundation/plip.git).

We also used [HoVer-Net model](https://github.com/vqdang/hover_net.git) with weights trained on [MoNuSAC](https://monusac-2020.grand-challenge.org) dataset and [Set Transformer](https://github.com/juho-lee/set_transformer.git) in this project.
